## This is portable configuration for my mpv windows

# INSTALLATION
- Clone the repository and put in current mpv installation (I use scoop to install my mpv)
- Change the forder name to 'portable_config'
- Done! You can open your mpv and configuration already applied.

### Note for me : I'm wanna use on my nix darwin configuration.
